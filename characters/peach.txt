## Peach
### Moves
| Move | Changes | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Down special | All turnips now deal the same regular DMG/knockback. Cannot pull items if items are set to not spawn. If down special is used while in float, it will throw the turnip, but will not end float. | |
| Forward smash | Now angleable instead of RNG. Up angle = Frying pan, Forward angle = Golf club, Down angle = Tennis racket | |
