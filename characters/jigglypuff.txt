Jigglypuff
---------------
* Attributes
    * Traction decreased, allowing much better ground movement
    * Crouch hurtbox made more consistent (does not bounce)
        * Can always be grabbed by Sheik and Marth dash grabs, but never by their standing grabs
* Down special
    * Duration decreased (249 -> 200)
    * BKB reduced, causing the move to start killing later (at about 25-35% before hit)
