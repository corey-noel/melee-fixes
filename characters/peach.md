## Peach
### Moves
| Move | Changes | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Down special | All turnips now deal the same regular DMG/knockback. <br>Cannot pull items if items are set to not spawn. <br>If down special is used while in float, it will throw the turnip, but will not end float. | |
| Forward smash | Now angleable instead of RNG: <br>Up angle = Frying pan <br>Forward angle = Golf club <br>Down angle = Tennis racket | I came up with this years before Ultimate came out, this is mine |
