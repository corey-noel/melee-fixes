| Move | Changes | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Neutral special | Soonest possible burst made sooner, shortly after the end of the startup animation <br>Bursts sooner after B is released (20 -> 10) <br>Lag after bursting heavily decreased <br>No longer puts Ness in helpless after using | |
| Up special | Projectile has a smaller turn radius and travels faster <br>Projectile is now transcendent | |
| PK Thunder 2 | When colliding with walls at a shallow (less than 45) angle, Ness will now ride the wall at the same angle instead of bouncing off of it (like spacies) <br>When colliding with walls at a steep angle (greater than 45), Ness will turn to ride up the wall (like the current Ness up special) <br>Hang time at the end of the launch reduced <br>Ability to drift immediately after hang time increased | |
| Side special | Projectile comes out much higher on Ness in the grounded version <br>Angle on aerial version made more shallow <br>Startup and endlag on both reduced by a few frames <br>Aerial version landcancels | Grounded version will catch low shorthops |
| Down special | Starts absorbing on frame 5 <br>Can be jump cancelled starting on frame 4 <br>Can be turned around during, akin to shine <br>Stops nearly all downward drifting in the air for a moment <br>Does not stop horizontal movement | Still doesn't have a hitbox, purely a movement tool that allows Ness to hang in the air before DJCing to mixup timings |
| Down air | Startup reduced slightly | Not 64 dair |
| Neutral air | BKB increased on both clean and late hit <br>Slight reduction to landing lag <br>Slight increase to range | |
| Up smash | Release hit KBG increased (and made more consistent) to serve as a vertical kill move <br>Yo-yo movement speed increased, letting it hit in front and then behind shortly after <br>Initial hit knockback reduced and made fixed, allowing it to combo into the charge hits | |
| Down smash | Release hit KBG increased, letting the move send offstage to set up edge guards <br>Yo-yo movement speed increased, letting it hit behind and then in front shortly after | Initial hit knockback reduced and made fixed, allowing it to combo into the charge hits |
| Up tilt | Hands made invincible | The head invincibility is useless otherwise, as his hands are higher than his head |
| Grab | Grab hitboxes for both grab and dash grab made larger | |
