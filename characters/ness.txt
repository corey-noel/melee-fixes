Ness
----------
* Attributes
    * Double jump dips and rises much faster. Can still DJC down and DJC to boost sideways
    * Increased max air speed and slight increase to air accel
    * Slight increase to initial dash speed
* Neutral special
    * Soonest possible burst made sooner, shortly after the end of the startup animation
    * Bursts sooner after B is released (20 -> 10)
    * Lag after bursting heavily decreased
    * No longer puts Ness in helpless after using
* Up special
    * Projectile has a smaller turn radius and travels faster
    * Projectile travels through players upon hitting them
    * PK Thunder 2
        * When colliding with walls at a shallow angle, Ness will now ride the wall at the same angle instead of bouncing off of it (like spacies)
        * When colliding with walls at a steep angle, Ness will turn to ride up the wall (like the current Ness up special)
        * Hang time at the end of the launch reduced
        * Ability to drift immediately after hang time increased
* Side special
    * Projectile comes out much higher on Ness in the grounded version, meaning it will catch low short hops
    * Angle on aerial version made more shallow
    * Startup and endlag both reduced by a few frames
    * Aerial version landcancels
    * Fire hitbox made slightly larger
* Down special
    * Starts absorbing on frame 5
    * Can be jump cancelled starting on frame 4
    * Can be turned around during, akin to shine
    * Stops nearly all downward drifting in the air for a moment
    * Does not stop horizontal movement
    * (Still doesn't have a hitbox, purely a movement tool that allows Ness to hang in the air before DJCing to mixup timings)
* Dash attack
    * First two hits made more horizontal and knockback increased to better combo
* Down air
    * Startup reduced slightly. (Not 64 dair)
* Neutral air
    * BKB increased on both clean and late hit
    * Slight reduction to landing lag
    * Slight increase to range
* Up smash
    * RIP yo-yo glitch, it's much too jank
    * Release hit KBG increased (and made more consistent) to serve as a vertical kill move
    * Yo-yo movement speed increased, letting it hit in front and then behind shortly after
    * Initial hit knockback reduced and made fixed, allowing it to combo into the charge hits
* Down smash
    * Release hit KBG increased, letting the move send offstage to set up edge guards
    * Yo-yo movement speed increased, letting it hit behind and then in front shortly after
    * Initial hit knockback reduced and made fixed, allowing it to combo into the charge hits
* Up tilt
    * Hands made invincible (the head invincibility is useless otherwise, as his hands are higher than his head)
* Grab
    * Grab hitboxes for both grab and dash grab made larger
