* Stages

| Damage to Charge | Effect | Notes | Damage Dealt | Recoil Damage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0-1 | No effect | Fizzles, resets to 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2-4 | A short, shine-esque burst. Sends up and away, has KBG | Doesn't come out frame 1 and not jump cancelable, but very quick with little lag. Doesn't necessarily combo floaties | 5 | 1 |
| 5-7 | A quick and damaging double hit. Meteors opponents twice, causing them to reel from the meteor angle long enough to be confirmed out of | Think Zelda down tilt (if it worked), but twice | 6 (x2) | 2 |
| 8+ | A kill move. Longer animation, some disjoint on all sides, slower startup | Shows a constant fizzle effect. Around the knockback you'd expect from a knee | 13 | 2 |

| Move | Changes | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Up air | Tail hitbox begins below Pichu rather than behind and travels up its back, returning to the front at the end of the move. DMG increased to 6%. BKB reduced | Allows it to hit in front of Pichu consistently |
| Forward air | Made into a strong single hit move with high BKB, a low launch angle, and very little KBG. Active on frame 13. 11% |
| Down air | Now a drill, hitting 4 times for a total of 8% <br>All hits spike with fixed knockback, making it a proper combo drill <br>Quake hitbox no longer fixed knockback | |
| Back air | KBG increased heavily, made into a proper sex kick kill move  <br>Active frames and duration decreased <br>Given an electric effect on the strong hit | |
| Forward smash | Only two repetitions of the early hitboxes and a larger finisher with better range <br>Early hits happen faster and deal less DMG | Gives opponents less time to escape |
| Down smash | Given an electric effect | |
| Forward tilt | Range increased slightly <br>BKB increased | |
| Grabs | Slightly increased range on both grab and dash grab | |
