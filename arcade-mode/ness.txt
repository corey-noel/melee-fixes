Ness
----------

* Neutral special
	* Projectile maneuverability increased massively
	* Once the projectile is produced by the neutral special animation, the animation ends
	* Ness can now move, shield, grab, and perform normal moves
	* The projectile will burst upon letting go of the B button with 8 frames of lag
	* If Ness is hit or grabbed before the projectile bursts (even if he has already let go of B) the projectile will fizzle and not burst
* Down special
	* If Ness holds down special for three seconds, he will drop a trap hitbox, whose location will be indicated by small visual effect
