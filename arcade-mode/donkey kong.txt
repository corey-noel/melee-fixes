Donkey Kong
----------

* Side special
	* Replaced with a barrel roll
	* DK rolls a barrel in front of himself
	* Barrel bounces at a fixed height (not dependent on distance fallen)
	* Horizontal speed is dependent on distance barrel fell during initial toss
	* Or, if the barrel falls off a platform, it will speed up

* Neutral special
	* Fully charges in two winds
