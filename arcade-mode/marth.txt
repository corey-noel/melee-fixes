----------

* Tippers on all moves given a new, special stun effect
* Duration of stun based on the amount of knockback taken from the move
* Once stunned, opponents are frozen where they are for what is essentially long, non-SDIable hitlag before they are sent flying
* Opponents will not fall during stun if they are not grounded
* When stun ends, opponents will go flying in whatever direction the move they were most recently hit by will send them
* In other words, if they are hit again during stun, they will take the trajectory of the move that hit them during stun
* Non-tipper hitboxes made uselessly weak and given priority over tipper hitboxes (which is even worse than them being removed)
