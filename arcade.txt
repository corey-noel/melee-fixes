Arcade mode
----------
* Arcade mode is a special Melee type
* In it, characters are modified to be moderately ridiculous
* They are buffed and silly, but not so far that the game becomes unplayable

Bowser
----------
* As Bowser deals damage or is damaged, he builds rage
* Taking damage results in gaining rage at a rate of .5 of the damage taken
* Dealing damage results in gaining rage at a rage equal to the damage dealt
* Once rage is at 80, it is considered to be full. This will be shown by a visual effect.
* Rage carries between stocks
* Down special
	* Replaced with Koopa Rage
	* Can only be used once rage is full
	* Drains rage to zero, and Bowser gain 10 seconds of the following effects
		* Projectile invincibility
		* Fire effects on all moves
		* Subtractive armor, slightly stronger than Yoshi's
		* Double damage dealt
		* Increased hitbox sizes
		* Increased run speed and weight
		* Decreased jump squat

Captain Falcon
----------
* Strong knee gives CF his double jump back
* Knee, stomp, and all grounded moves are interruptible with jump

Donkey Kong
----------
* Side special
	* Replaced with a barrel roll
	* DK rolls a barrel in front of himself
	* Barrel bounces at a fixed height (not dependent on distance fallen)
	* Horizontal speed is dependent on distance barrel fell during initial toss
	* Or, if the barrel falls off a platform, it will speed up
* Neutral special
	* Fully charges in two winds

Link
----------
* Down special
	* Made into a toggle between regular mode and bomb mode
	* Regular mode is, well, regular
	* In bomb mode, all of Link's normals are replaced with the bomb throw tied to that move, with the exception of z-dropping

Marth
----------
* Tippers on all moves given a new, special stun effect
* Duration of stun based on the amount of knockback taken from the move
* Once stunned, opponents are frozen where they are for what is essentially long, non-SDIable hitlag before they are sent flying
* Opponents will not fall during stun if they are not grounded
* When stun ends, opponents will go flying in whatever direction the move they were most recently hit by will send them
* In other words, if they are hit again during stun, they will take the trajectory of the move that hit them during stun
* Non-tipper hitboxes made uselessly weak and given priority over tipper hitboxes (which is even worse than them being removed)

Ness
----------
* Neutral special
	* Projectile maneuverability increased massively
	* Once the projectile is produced by the neutral special animation, the animation ends
	* Ness can now move, shield, grab, and perform normal moves
	* The projectile will burst upon letting go of the B button with 8 frames of lag
	* If Ness is hit or grabbed before the projectile bursts (even if he has already let go of B) the projectile will fizzle and not burst
* Down special
	* If Ness holds down special for three seconds, he will drop a trap hitbox, whose location will be indicated by small visual effect

Peach
----------
* Peach's down special no longer pulls turnips, but now instead pulls various items from the game
* Consumable items are immediately consumed
* Some items are more rare than others and appear much less often due to power level
	* Super Star
	* Heart container
	* Hammer

Sheik/Zelda
----------
* Down special
	* Transform is only one frame long
