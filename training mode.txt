    * Each port selects a character and whether or not they are an AI
    * At least one port must be set to being a human to start

                * All empty space before the first input and after the last input will be trimmed
                * If buttons are being held when you start recording, these will not count toward "untrimmed" frames. The game will look for the first change to an button input or a stick. (This means you can input stuff like quick shield drops easily, by holding shield and a direction when you are holding start. The game will only care about what is input after you start to tilt shield).
