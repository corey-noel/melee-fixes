# Arcade Mode

* Arcade Mode allows players to apply upgrade power-ups to each character

* Each character has three distinct upgrades that may be toggled on and off

### Sheik/Zelda
#### Upgrade A
* Transform is 4 frames long
#### Upgrade B
* Both needles and Din's Fire send toward the player

### Marth
#### Upgrade A
* Tipper forward smash and down air both put opponents into a hitlag-like stun state
* Only players who have not been stunned in the past 60 frames can be stunned
* Stun length is a fixed value for each move
* Stunned players are frozen in space and cannot SDI during stun
* If stunned players are hit again they are not launched immediately (they stay in stun)
* Instead, upon leaving stun, they are sent with the knockback of the most recent move to hit them
* Stunned players cannot be grabbed

### Peach
#### Upgrade A
* Down special can pull any item
* "Use" items will activate immediately upon being pulled (like food & warp stars)
* There is a distribution of likelihood of item pulls, with more powerful items being rarer

### Donkey Kong
#### Upgrade A
* All aerials are active on frame 4
#### Upgrade B
* Aerial down special is now a slow command grab that goes directly into cargo throw
#### Upgrade C
* Fully charges in two winds

### Ice Climbers
#### Upgrade A
* 3 of them.

### Young Link
#### Upgrade A
* Down air comes out faster
* Down air bounce is interruptible with any action
* Down air knockback growth massively reduced

### Link
#### Upgrade A
* Arrow charge can be stored like any other charge projectile

### Captain Falcon
#### Upgrade A
* Both hard and soft knee give CF his double jump back
