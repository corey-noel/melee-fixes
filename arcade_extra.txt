Bowser
----------
* As Bowser deals damage or is damaged, he builds rage
* Taking damage results in gaining rage at a rate of .5 of the damage taken
* Dealing damage results in gaining rage at a rage equal to the damage dealt
* Once rage is at 80, it is considered to be full. This will be shown by a visual effect.
* Rage carries between stocks
* Down special
	* Replaced with Koopa Rage
	* Can only be used once rage is full
	* Drains rage to zero, and Bowser gain 10 seconds of the following effects
		* Projectile invincibility
		* Fire effects on all moves
		* Subtractive armor, slightly stronger than Yoshi's
		* Double damage dealt
		* Increased hitbox sizes
		* Increased run speed and weight

Ness
----------
* Neutral special
	* Projectile maneuverability increased massively
	* Once the projectile is produced by the neutral special animation, the animation ends
	* Ness can now move, shield, grab, and perform normal moves
	* The projectile will burst upon letting go of the B button with 8 frames of lag
	* If Ness is hit or grabbed before the projectile bursts (even if he has already let go of B) the projectile will fizzle and not burst
* Down special
	* If Ness holds down special for three seconds, he will drop a trap hitbox, whose location will be indicated by small visual effect
